Human development is autonomous and dynamic: humans decide by themselves what to do, what to learn or what they are more interested in. For example, infants often do not play with the toys shown by the parents/other adults, but they invent their own toys and learning sequences. So far, no intelligent machine has the capacity to develop in an autonomous open-ended manner through lifelong learning and interactions. Building such a robot/machine is one of greatest challenges of robotics and machine learning. If we are to see robots learning in an autonomous and open-ended manner, we need to develop methods for incremental and autonomous skill discovery and trial-and-error learning. In other words, we want our robots to be able to autonomously select their goals according to their current capabilities and learn controllers or policies to achieve those goals. NOSALRO aims at tackling this challenge by exploiting deterministic simulations, quality diversity (QD) optimization, and Variational Auto-Encoders for exploring the state-space, and Learning from Demonstration (LfD) methods for fast and robust learning of high-performing controllers. We envision a robot that possess internal models of the world (e.g., simulators) and performs cycles of days and nights, where the days the robot interacts with the environment, and the night uses probabilistic models to improve the already learned or discover new skills. The developed methods will be extensively evaluated on realistic open-ended simulation environments, that will emulate the physical world, of increasing difficulty and complexity: ranging from mobile manipulators in domestic environments to humanoid robots in unstructured environments.</p> <p>The project is funded by Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (H.F.R.I.) under the \"3rd Call for H.F.R.I.

Traditional robot learning, on the contrary, relies on dynamical system-based policies that can be analyzed for stability/safety.

In this work, we bridge the gap between generic neural network policies and dynamical system-based policies, and we introduce Autonomous Neural Dynamic Policies (ANDPs) that: (a) are based on autonomous dynamical systems, (b) always produce asymptotically stable behaviors, and (c) are more flexible than traditional stable dynamical system-based policies. ANDPs are fully differentiable, flexible generic-policies that accept any observation input, while ensuring asymptotic stability. Through several experiments, we explore the flexibility and capacity of ANDPs in several imitation learning tasks including experiments with image observations.

Existing methods for kinodynamic planning primarily fall into two categories: (a) stochastic planners, such as Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) and Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM), which excel in state-space exploration due to their directed randomness, and (b) optimization-based approaches, which are well-suited for structured environments, producing smooth and optimal solutions. In this work, we present Hybrid Trajectory Exploration for Kinodynamic Planning (HyTraX), a hybrid framework that integrates the strengths of these two paradigms. Specifically, HyTraX enhances the effectiveness of the Go-Explore algorithm by incorporating trajectory optimization with random target selection as its core exploration strategy. We evaluate HyTraX on two challenging kinodynamic motion planning tasks: a car-like agent and a planar quadrotor navigating through maze environments.

They offer an optimal trade-off between mobility and payload capacity, excelling in diverse environments while maintaining efficiency in transporting heavy loads. However, planning and optimizing gaits and gait sequences for these robots presents significant challenges due to the complexity of their dynamic motion and the numerous optimization variables involved. Traditional trajectory optimization methods address these challenges by formulating the problem as an optimization task, aiming to minimize cost functions, and to automatically discover contact sequences. Despite their structured approach, optimization-based methods face substantial difficulties, particularly because such formulations result in highly nonlinear and difficult to solve problems. To address these limitations, we propose CrEGOpt, a bi-level optimization method that combines traditional trajectory optimization with a black-box optimization scheme. CrEGOpt at the higher level employs the Mixed Distribution Cross-Entropy Method to optimize both the gait sequence and the phase durations, thus simplifying the lower level trajectory optimization problem. This approach allows for fast solutions of complex gait optimization problems. Extensive evaluation in simulated environments demonstrates that CrEGOpt can find solutions for biped, quadruped, and hexapod robots in under 10 seconds. This novel bi-level optimization scheme offers a promising direction for future research in automatic contact scheduling.</p> <p>* Equal Contribution</p> <p>(view online) (web) (code)</p>"},{"location":"publications/#4-asimakopoulos-k-androutsopoulos-a-vrahatis-m-and-chatzilygeroudis-k-2024-effective-kinodynamic-planning-and-exploration-through-quality-diversity-and-trajectory-optimization-the-18th-learning-and-intelligent-optimization-conference-lion","title":"4.

He was the principal investigator of an ERC grant (ResiBots - Robots with animal-like resilience, 2015-2020) and was the recipient of a French ANR young researcher grant (Creadapt - Creative adaptation by Evolution, 2012-2015).  His work was featured on the cover of Nature (Cully et al., 2015) and it received the 2017 ISAL award for Distinguished Young Investigator in the field of Artificial Life, the French La Recherche award (2016), and several best papers awards in major scientific conferences.</p> <p>Website: https://members.loria.fr/JBMouret</p>"},{"location":"team/#dimitrios-kanoulas","title":"Dimitrios Kanoulas","text":"<p>Short bio: Dimitrios Kanoulas is a UKRI Future Leader Fellow and Associate Professor in Robotics and Computation at University College London (UCL), Department of Computer Science, working in the field of perception and learning for robots that have limbs, including quadrupeds, humanoids, and mobile manipulators. Between 2014-2019 he was a senior postdoctoral researcher at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), working with Profs Nikos Tsagarakis and Darwin Caldwell on several EU projects. In August 2014, he completed his PhD at Northeastern University, advised by Prof. Marsette Vona on perception for bipedal locomotion. He started out as a member of the Algorithms and Theory group at Northeastern University. During the summer of 2012, he completed an internship at INRIA in France, advised by Drs Christian Laugier and Alexandros Makris.

His current research focuses on enhancing robotic capabilities by integrating large language and vision-language models, as well as developing methods for learning bimanual robot skills with human guidance and natural language interaction. Prior to this, he gained industry experience as a Robotics Engineer at Ragdoll Dynamics, London, UK (2022\u20132023), where he contributed to improving animator workflows by applying robotic control and simulation techniques in Maya. Dionis also held a research role at the AI Group of the Laboratory of Information Systems and Artificial Intelligence, University of Patras (2021\u20132023), where he worked on advancing neural dynamic policies, reinforcement learning, learning from demonstration, and optimal control strategies. He earned his Integrated Master degree in Computer Engineering and Informatics from the University of Patras in 2023. His academic and professional journey reflects a strong passion for bridging the gap between artificial intelligence research and real-world applications, with interests in robot learning, human-robot interaction, and autonomous skill acquisition.</p> <p>Website: https://github.com/dtotsila</p>"},{"location":"team/#agisilaos-kounelis","title":"Agisilaos Kounelis","text":"<p>Short bio: Agisilaos Kounelis is a Computer Engineering &amp; Informatics graduate from the University of Patras, Greece.
