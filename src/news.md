## 28th May 2023

We are excited to announce that we have a short paper accepted at the [Life-Long Learning with Human Help (L3H2) Workshop](https://life-long-learning-with-human-help-l3h2.github.io/) at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). We will be presenting our work in progress on **"Sensorimotor Learning with Stability Guarantees via Autonomous Neural Dynamic Policies"** (paper title: **"End-to-End Stable Imitation Learning via Autonomous Neural Dynamic Policies"**). This is a collaboration of Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis with the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department of University of Patras (Dionis Totsila and Ioannis Hatzilygeroudis) and the Robot Perception and Learning Lab of UCL (Denis Hadjivelichkov, Valerio Modugno and Dimitrios Kanoulas). *Valerio Modugno* will be giving a short talk and presenting a [poster](files/2023-ICRA-L3H2-Poster-ANDPs.pdf). More information on our paper [here](publications.md).

We are excited to announce that we will participate to the online [Embodied Intelligence Conference 2023](https://embodied-intelligence.org/) that will take place virtually on March 22-24, 2023. We will be presenting our work in progress on **"Sensorimotor Learning with Stability Guarantees via Autonomous Neural Dynamic Policies"**. This is a collaboration of Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis with the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department of University of Patras (Dionis Totsila and Ioannis Hatzilygeroudis) and the Robot Perception and Learning Lab of UCL (Denis Hadjivelichkov, Valerio Modugno and Dimitrios Kanoulas). We will give a short talk and participate in the discussions at the afternoon session of Day 2.

## 15th March 2023

Our paper **"Fast and Robust Constrained Optimization via Evolutionary and Quadratic Programming"** by *K. Chatzilygeroudis and M. Vrahatis* has been accepted for presentation at the *international conference [LION17](https://lion17.org/)*. More information on our paper [here](publications.md). See you at Nice in June 2023!

## 24th October 2022

The project has officially started! Stay tuned for results!
