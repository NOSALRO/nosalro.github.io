## 20th March 2023

We are excited to announce that we will participate to the online [Embodied Intelligence Conference 2023](https://embodied-intelligence.org/) presenting our work in progress on **"Sensorimotor Learning with Stability Guarantees via Autonomous Neural Dynamic Policies"**. This is a collaboration with Computer Engineering and Informatics Department of University of Patras (Dionis Totsila and Ioannis Hatzilygeroudis) and the Robot Perception and Learning Lab of UCL (Denis Hadjivelichkov3, Valerio Modugno and Dimitrios Kanoulas). We will give a short talk and participate in the discussions at the afternoon session of Day 2.
